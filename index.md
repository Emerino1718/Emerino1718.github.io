This is my first year at CSUF and I'm hoping to graduate with a degree in 
Computer Science by 2028

## Favorite Computer Science Labs:

* Lab 07 Part 1:
 Lab 07 is my favorite lab out of all the others because not only did I feel like
 I had a good idea of what to do, but I also got to practice using || and && for
 certain parking availability conditions, which at the time was something I was
 struggling with. Although I did like the lab and the practice I could get
 thanks to it I also really enjoyed this lab because of my partner Adrian. 
 Thanks to him I was able to learn shortcuts and simpler ways to code in 
 addition to having someone at a similar level of programming which, by the way,
 made getting the work done so much easier but it also made it a fun experience 
 where we would talk through the problems instead of staring at the computer 
 blankly and expecting me to do the work.

* Lab 01
 My second favorite lab was the first one I attended. I know we didn’t do
 anything complicated but I was super excited to be a part of this class and was
 ready to start collaborating with people who had previous experience in coding.
 That day I surprisingly made some good friends in the class by racing to get
 our teaching assistant’s attention before this group of boys (they bet that we 
 couldn’t finish before them) After finishing an hour after class ended we 
 eventually finished the lab at the same time but after that we all began 
 hanging out outside of class and walking each other to our cars to make sure 
 everyone got there safely after we finished our lab.

* Lab 06 Part 2
 This is my third favorite lab because we got to program a game with more 
 complexity. The other labs had guessing games and fill-in-the-blank programs 
 but blackjack was more entertaining especially since I had never heard of this
 game before. What I also liked about this lab was that it gave me an idea of
 what it would be like to create a program for video games which is a recent 
 interest I have. Although this lab was fun I did struggle to remember the rules
 that were discussed in the lab and I also set strings (the name of the card 
 i.e. A instead of “A”) as integers but thanks to my partner we were able to 
 catch the mistake.
