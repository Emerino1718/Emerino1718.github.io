# Emily Merino's Portfolio

This is my first year at CSUF and I'm hoping to graduate with a degree in 
Computer Science by 2028

## Favorite CPSC 120L:

* Lab 07 Part 1:
 Lab 07 is my favorite lab out of all the others because not only did I feel like
 I had a good idea of what to do, but I also got to practice using || and && for
 certain parking availability conditions, which at the time was something I was
 struggling with. Although I did like the lab and the practice I could get
 thanks to it I also really enjoyed this lab because of my partner Adrian. 
 Thanks to him I was able to learn shortcuts and simpler ways to code in 
 addition to having someone at a similar level of programming which, by the way,
 made getting the work done so much easier but it also made it a fun experience 
 where we would talk through the problems instead of staring at the computer 
 blankly and expecting me to do the work.

* Lab 01
  My second favorite lab was the first one I attended. I know we didn’t do
 anything complicated but I was super excited to be a part of this class. Thanks
 to this lab, I was able to learn how to navigate through the terminal, print out
 text, and make good friends and lab partners while doing it.

* Lab 06 Part 2
 This is my third favorite lab because we got to program a game with more 
 complexity. The other labs had guessing games and fill-in-the-blank programs 
 but blackjack was more entertaining especially since I had never heard of this
 game before. What I also liked about this lab was that it gave me an idea of
 what it would be like to create a program for video games which is a recent 
 interest I have. Although this lab was fun I did struggle to remember the rules
 that were discussed in the lab and I also set strings (the name of the card 
 i.e. A instead of “A”) as integers but thanks to my partner we were able to 
 catch the mistake.
