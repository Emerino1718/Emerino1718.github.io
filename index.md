# Emily Merino's Portfolio

This is my first year at CSUF and I'm hoping to graduate with a degree in 
Computer Science by 2028

## Favorite CPSC 120L:

* Lab 07 Part 1:

  Lab 07 is my favorite lab out of all the others because not only did I feel like
  I had a good idea of what to do, but I also learned how to use || and && for
  certain parking availability conditions, which I was struggling to 
  understand when to use which operator. Although I did like the
  lab and the practice I got from it, a big part of why I also really enjoyed the
  lab was because of my partner. Working with them was great we communicated well,
  we were able to debug most of our errors, and I was able to learn new shortcuts
  and simpler ways to code.

* Lab 01

  I know we didn’t do anything complicated in this lab but it's still one of my
  favorites because I was super excited to be a part of this class. Thanks to
  this lab, I was able to learn how to navigate through the terminal, print out
  text, and make good friends while doing it.

* Lab 06 Part 2

  This is my third favorite lab because we got to program a game with more 
  complexity. The other labs had guessing games and fill-in-the-blank programs 
  but blackjack was more entertaining especially since I had never heard of this
  game before. What I also liked about this lab was that it gave me an idea of
  what it would be like to create a program for video games which is a recent 
  interest I have. Although this lab was fun I did struggle to remember the rules
  that were discussed in the lab and I also set strings (the name of the card 
  i.e. A instead of “A”) as integers but thanks to my partner we were able to 
  catch the mistake. Thanks to this lab I learned how important it is to match
  the types (i.e. int with int and strings with strings) and how to create
  simpler if statements with conditions while using ||.
